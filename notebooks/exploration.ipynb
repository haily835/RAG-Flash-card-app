It has eﬃcient high-level data structures and\\na simple but eﬀective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic\\ntyping, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application\\ndevelopment in many areas on most platforms.\\nThe Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all\\nmajor platforms from the Python Web site,https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The\\nsame site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs\\nand tools, and additional documentation.\\nThe Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++\\n(or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable\\napplications.\\nThis tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language\\nand system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are\\nself-contained, so the tutorial can be read oﬀ-line as well.\\nFor a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal\\ndeﬁnition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There\\nare also several books covering Python in depth.\\nThis tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly\\nused feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good\\nidea of the language’s ﬂavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules\\nand programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in\\nlibrary-index.\\nThe Glossary is also worth going through.\\nCONTENTS 1'),\n",

For\\nexample, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text ﬁles, or rename and\\nrearrange a bunch of photo ﬁles in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database,\\nor a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.\\nIf you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but\\nﬁnd the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such\\na library and ﬁnd writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could\\nuse an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your\\napplication.\\nPython is just the language for you.\\nYou could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch ﬁles for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best\\nat moving around ﬁles and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could\\nwrite a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a ﬁrst-draft program.\\nPython is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you\\nget the job done more quickly.\\nPython is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, oﬀering much more structure and support\\nfor large programs than shell scripts or batch ﬁles can oﬀer. On the other hand, Python also oﬀers much\\nmore error checking than C, and, being avery-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such\\nas ﬂexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much\\nlarger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those\\nlanguages.\\nPython allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It\\ncomes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as\\nexamples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like ﬁle I/O, system\\ncalls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\\nPython is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development\\nbecause no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it\\neasy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during\\nbottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\\nPython enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically\\nmuch shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:\\n• the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\\n• statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;\\n• no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\\nPython isextensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module\\nto the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to\\nlibraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-speciﬁc graphics library).

(E.g.,/usr/local/python\\nis a popular alternative location.)\\nOn Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\, though \\nyou can change this when you’re running the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can \\ntype the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:\\nset path=%path%;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\\\nT\\nyping an end-of-ﬁle character (Control-Don Unix,Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes\\nthe interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing\\nthe following command:quit().\\nThe interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion\\non systems that support readline. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is\\nsupported is typing Control-P to the ﬁrst Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line\\nediting; see AppendixInteractive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If\\nnothing appears to happen, or if^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to\\nuse backspace to remove characters from the current line.\\nThe interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty\\ndevice, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a ﬁle name argument or with a ﬁle\\nas standard input, it reads and executes ascript from that ﬁle.\\nA second way of starting the interpreter ispython -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s)\\nin command, analogous to the shell’s-c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other\\ncharacters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quotecommand in its entirety with single\\nquotes.\\nSome Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked usingpython -m module [arg] ...,\\nwhich executes the source ﬁle formodule as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.\\nWhen a script ﬁle is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode\\nafterwards. This can be done by passing-i before the script.\\n1 On\\nUnix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not\\nconﬂict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.\\n5'),\n",

In this mode it prompts\\nfor the next command with theprimary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines\\nit prompts with thesecondary prompt, by default three dots (...).

To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the ﬁle is UTF-8, and it\\nmust use a font that supports all the characters in the ﬁle.\\nTo declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as theﬁrst line\\nof the ﬁle.

Note that a secondary prompt on a line\\nby itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.\\nMany of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments.\\nComments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A\\ncomment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal.\\nA hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are\\nnot interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.\\nSome examples:\\n# this is the first comment\\nspam = 1 # and this is the second comment\\n# ... and now a third!\\ntext = \"# This is not a comment because it\\'s inside quotes.\"\\n3.1 Using Python as a Calculator\\nLet’s try some simple Python commands.

For example:\\n>>> 2 + 2\\n4\\n>>> 50 - 5*6\\n20\\n>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4\\n5.0\\n>>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number\\n1.6\\nThe integer numbers (e.g.2, 4, 20) have typeint, the ones with a fractional part (e.g.5.0, 1.6) have type\\nfloat.

For instance,\\nwe can write an initial sub-sequence of theFibonacci seriesas follows:\\n>>> # Fibonacci series:\\n... # the sum of two elements defines the next\\n... a, b = 0, 1\\n>>> while a < 10:\\n... print(a)\\n... a, b = b, a+b\\n...\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n5\\n8\\nThis example introduces several new features.\\n• The ﬁrst line contains amultiple assignment : the variablesa and b simultaneously get the new values\\n0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side\\nare all evaluated ﬁrst before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are\\nevaluated from the left to the right.\\n• The while loop executes as long as the condition (here:a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C,\\nany non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in\\nfact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used\\nin the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in\\nC: < (less than),> (greater than),== (equal to),<= (less than or equal to),>= (greater than or equal\\nto) and!= (not equal to).\\n• Thebody of the loop isindented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive\\nprompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more\\ncomplicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility.\\nWhen a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate\\ncompletion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line\\nwithin a basic block must be indented by the same amount.\\n• The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given.

For example:\\n>>> x = int(input(\"Please enter an integer: \"))\\nPlease enter an integer: 42\\n>>> if x < 0:\\n... x = 0\\n... print(\\'Negative changed to zero\\')\\n... elif x == 0:\\n... print(\\'Zero\\')\\n... elif x == 1:\\n... print(\\'Single\\')\\n... else:\\n... print(\\'More\\')\\n...\\nMore\\nThere can be zero or moreelif parts, and theelse part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else\\nif’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. Anif … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the\\nswitch or case statements found in other languages.\\n4.2 for Statements\\nThe for statement in Python diﬀers a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always\\niterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to deﬁne\\nboth the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’sfor statement iterates over the items of any\\nsequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):\\n>>> # Measure some strings:\\n... words = [\\'cat\\', \\'window\\', \\'defenestrate\\']\\n>>> for w in words:\\n... print(w, len(w))\\n...\\ncat 3\\nwindow 6\\ndefenestrate 12\\n19'),\n",

Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly\\nmake a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:\\n>>> for w in words[:]: # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.\\n... if len(w) > 6:\\n... words.insert(0, w)\\n...\\n>>> words\\n['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']\\nWith for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an inﬁnite list, insertingdefenestrate over\\nand over again.\\n4.3 The range() Function\\nIf you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in functionrange() comes in handy. It\\ngenerates arithmetic progressions:\\n>>> for i in range(5):\\n... print(i)\\n...\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nThe given end point is never part of the generated sequence;range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices\\nfor items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a\\ndiﬀerent increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):\\nrange(5, 10)\\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\nrange(0, 10, 3)\\n0, 3, 6, 9\\nrange(-10, -100, -30)\\n-10, -40, -70\\nTo iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combinerange() and len() as follows:\\n>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']\\n>>> for i in range(len(a)):\\n... print(i, a[i])\\n...\\n0 Mary\\n1 had\\n2 a\\n3 little\\n4 lamb\\nIn most such cases, however, it is convenient to use theenumerate() function, seeLooping T echniques.\\nA strange thing happens if you just print a range:\\n20 Chapter 4.

This is exempliﬁed by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:\\n>>> for n in range(2, 10):\\n... for x in range(2, n):\\n... if n % x == 0:\\n... print(n, \\'equals\\', x, \\'*\\', n//x)\\n... break\\n... else:\\n... # loop fell through without finding a factor\\n... print(n, \\'is a prime number\\')\\n...\\n2 is a prime number\\n3 is a prime number\\n4 equals 2 * 2\\n5 is a prime number\\n6 equals 2 * 3\\n7 is a prime number\\n8 equals 2 * 4\\n9 equals 3 * 3\\n(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: theelse clause belongs to thefor loop, not the if statement.)\\nWhen used with a loop, theelse clause has more in common with theelse clause of atry statement than it\\ndoes that ofif statements: atry statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’selse\\nclause runs when nobreak occurs. For more on thetry statement and exceptions, seeHandling Exceptions.\\nThe continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:\\n>>> for num in range(2, 10):\\n... if num % 2 == 0:\\n... print(\"Found an even number\", num)\\n... continue\\n... print(\"Found a number\", num)\\nFound an even number 2\\n(continues on next page)\\n4.4. break and continue Statements, andelse Clauses on Loops 21'),\n",

It must be followed by the function name and the\\nparenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next\\nline, and must be indented.\\nThe ﬁrst statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s\\ndocumentation string, or docstring.

There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation,\\nor to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you\\nwrite, so make a habit of it.\\nThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More\\nprecisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable\\nreferences ﬁrst look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in\\nthe global symbol table, and ﬁnally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly\\nassigned a value within a function (unless named in aglobal statement), although they may be referenced.\\nThe actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called\\nfunction when it is called; thus, arguments are passed usingcal l by value(where thevalue is always an object\\nreference, not the value of the object).1 When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is\\ncreated for that call.\\nA function deﬁnition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function\\nname has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-deﬁned function. This value can be assigned\\nto another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:\\n>>> fib\\n<function fib at 10042ed0>\\n>>> f = fib\\n>>> f(100)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89\\nComing from other languages, you might object thatfib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t\\nreturn a value. In fact, even functions without areturn statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring\\none. This value is calledNone (it’s a built-in name). Writing the valueNone is normally suppressed by the\\ninterpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to usingprint():\\n>>> fib(0)\\n>>> print(fib(0))\\nNone\\nIt is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing\\nit:\\n>>> def fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n\\n... \"\"\"Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\"\\n... result = []\\n... a, b = 0, 1\\n... while a < n:\\n... result.append(a) # see below\\n... a, b = b, a+b\\n... return result\\n...\\n>>> f100 = fib2(100) # call it\\n>>> f100 # write the result\\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\\nThis example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:\\n• The return statement returns with a value from a function.return without an expression argument\\nreturns None. Falling oﬀ the end of a function also returnsNone.\\n• The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list objectresult. A method is a function\\nthat ‘belongs’ to an object and is namedobj.methodname, whereobj is some object (this may be an\\n1 Actually ,cal l by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any\\nchanges the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list).\\n4.6.

Diﬀerent\\ntypes deﬁne diﬀerent methods. Methods of diﬀerent types may have the same name without causing\\nambiguity. (It is possible to deﬁne your own object types and methods, usingclasses, seeClasses) The\\nmethod append() shown in the example is deﬁned for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of\\nthe list. In this example it is equivalent toresult = result + [a], but more eﬃcient.\\n4.7 More on Deﬁning Functions\\nIt is also possible to deﬁne functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which\\ncan be combined.\\n4.7.1 Default Argument Values\\nThe most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that\\ncan be called with fewer arguments than it is deﬁned to allow. For example:\\ndef ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):\\nwhile True:\\nok = input(prompt)\\nif ok in ('y', 'ye', 'yes'):\\nreturn True\\nif ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'):\\nreturn False\\nretries = retries - 1\\nif retries < 0:\\nraise ValueError('invalid user response')\\nprint(reminder)\\nThis function can be called in several ways:\\n• giving only the mandatory argument:ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')\\n• giving one of the optional arguments:ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)\\n• or even giving all arguments:ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or\\nno!')\\nThis example also introduces thein keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.\\nThe default values are evaluated at the point of function deﬁnition in thedeﬁning scope, so that\\ni = 5\\ndef f(arg=i):\\nprint(arg)\\ni = 6\\nf()\\nwill print5.\\nImportant warning: The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a diﬀerence when the default is\\na mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function\\naccumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\\n24 Chapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\"),\n",

This\\nfunction can be called in any of the following ways:\\nparrot(1000) # 1 positional argument\\nparrot(voltage=1000) # 1 keyword argument\\nparrot(voltage=1000000, action=\\'VOOOOOM\\') # 2 keyword arguments\\nparrot(action=\\'VOOOOOM\\', voltage=1000000) # 2 keyword arguments\\nparrot(\\'a million\\', \\'bereft of life\\', \\'jump\\') # 3 positional arguments\\nparrot(\\'a thousand\\', state=\\'pushing up the daisies\\') # 1 positional, 1 keyword\\nbut all the following calls would be invalid:\\nparrot() # required argument missing\\nparrot(voltage=5.0, \\'dead\\') # non-keyword argument after a keyword argument\\nparrot(110, voltage=220) # duplicate value for the same argument\\nparrot(actor=\\'John Cleese\\') # unknown keyword argument\\nIn a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.

Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.\\nThey are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a\\nnormal function deﬁnition.

This line should begin with a capital letter and end\\nwith a period.\\nIf there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the\\nsummary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing\\nthe object’s calling conventions, its side eﬀects, etc.\\nThe Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process\\ndocumentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The\\nﬁrst non-blank line after the ﬁrst line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire\\ndocumentation string. (We can’t use the ﬁrst line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes\\nso its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then\\nstripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they\\noccur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after\\nexpansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).\\nHere is an example of a multi-line docstring:\\n>>> def my_function():\\n... \"\"\"Do nothing, but document it.\\n...\\n... No, really, it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n... \"\"\"\\n... pass\\n...\\n>>> print(my_function.__doc__)\\nDo nothing, but document it.\\nNo, really, it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n4.7.7 Function Annotations\\nFunction annotations are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-deﬁned\\nfunctions (seePEP 3107 and PEP 484 for more information).\\nAnnotations are stored in the__annotations__ attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no eﬀect\\non any other part of the function. Parameter annotations are deﬁned by a colon after the parameter name,\\nfollowed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are deﬁned by a\\nliteral ->, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of thedef\\nstatement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value\\nannotated:\\n>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = \\'eggs\\') -> str:\\n... print(\"Annotations:\", f.__annotations__)\\n(continues on next page)\\n28 Chapter 4.

Most languages can be written (or more concise,formatted) in diﬀerent styles; some are more\\nreadable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice\\ncoding style helps tremendously for that.\\nFor Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very\\nreadable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the\\nmost important points extracted for you:\\n• Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\\n4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large\\nindentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\\n• Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\\nThis helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code ﬁles side-by-side on\\nlarger displays.\\n• Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\\n• When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\\n• Use docstrings.\\n• Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs:a =\\nf(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\\n• Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to useCamelCase for classes and\\nlower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always useself as the name for the ﬁrst\\nmethod argument (seeA First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\\n• Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s\\ndefault, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\\n• Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identiﬁers if there is only the slightest chance people\\nspeaking a diﬀerent language will read or maintain the code.\\n4.8.

To add an item to the top of the stack, useappend(). To retrieve an item\\nfrom the top of the stack, usepop() without an explicit index.

While appends and pops from the end of list are\\nfast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be\\nshifted by one).\\nTo implement a queue, usecollections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from\\nboth ends. For example:\\n>>> from collections import deque\\n>>> queue = deque([\"Eric\", \"John\", \"Michael\"])\\n>>> queue.append(\"Terry\") # Terry arrives\\n>>> queue.append(\"Graham\") # Graham arrives\\n>>> queue.popleft() # The first to arrive now leaves\\n\\'Eric\\'\\n>>> queue.popleft() # The second to arrive now leaves\\n\\'John\\'\\n>>> queue # Remaining queue in order of arrival\\ndeque([\\'Michael\\', \\'Terry\\', \\'Graham\\'])\\n5.1.3 List Comprehensions\\nList comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where\\neach element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to\\ncreate a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.\\nFor example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:\\n>>> squares = []\\n>>> for x in range(10):\\n... squares.append(x**2)\\n...\\n>>> squares\\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\\nNote that this creates (or overwrites) a variable namedx that still exists after the loop completes. We can\\ncalculate the list of squares without any side eﬀects using:\\nsquares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))\\nor, equivalently:\\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\\nwhich is more concise and readable.\\nA list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by afor clause, then zero or\\nmore for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context\\nof thefor and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if\\nthey are not equal:\\n>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]\\n[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\nand it’s equivalent to:\\n5.1.

They\\nare two examples ofsequence data types (see typesseq). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence\\ndata types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: thetuple.\\nA tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:\\n>>> t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'\\n>>> t[0]\\n12345\\n>>> t\\n(12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\')\\n>>> # Tuples may be nested:\\n... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\\n>>> u\\n((12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\\n>>> # Tuples are immutable:\\n... t[0] = 88888\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: \\'tuple\\' object does not support item assignment\\n>>> # but they can contain mutable objects:\\n... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\n>>> v\\n([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\nAs you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted\\ncorrectly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are\\nnecessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual\\nitems of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.\\nThough tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in diﬀerent situations and for diﬀerent purposes.\\nTuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via\\nunpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case ofnamedtuples). Lists are\\nmutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.\\nA special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to\\naccommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is\\nconstructed by following a value with a comma (it is not suﬃcient to enclose a single value in parentheses).\\nUgly, but eﬀective.

The reverse operation is also possible:\\n>>> x, y, z = t\\nThis is called, appropriately enough,sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side.\\nSequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are\\nelements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and\\nsequence unpacking.\\n5.4 Sets\\nPython also includes a data type forsets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic\\nuses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical\\noperations like union, intersection, diﬀerence, and symmetric diﬀerence.\\nCurly braces or theset() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use\\nset(), not{}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.\\nHere is a brief demonstration:\\n>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}\\n>>> print(basket) # show that duplicates have been removed\\n{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}\\n>>> 'orange' in basket # fast membership testing\\nTrue\\n>>> 'crabgrass' in basket\\nFalse\\n>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words\\n...\\n>>> a = set('abracadabra')\\n>>> b = set('alacazam')\\n>>> a # unique letters in a\\n{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\\n>>> a - b # letters in a but not in b\\n{'r', 'd', 'b'}\\n>>> a | b # letters in a or b or both\\n{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\\n>>> a & b # letters in both a and b\\n{'a', 'c'}\\n>>> a ^ b # letters in a or b but not both\\n{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\\nSimilarly tolist comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\\n>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}\\n>>> a\\n{'r', 'd'}\\n5.4.

Dictionaries are sometimes\\nfound in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are\\nindexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed bykeys, which can be any immutable type; strings\\nand numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples;\\nif a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use\\nlists as keys, since lists can be modiﬁed in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like\\nappend() and extend().\\nIt is best to think of a dictionary as a set ofkey: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique\\n(within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated\\nlist of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way\\ndictionaries are written on output.\\nThe main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the\\nkey.

All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all\\nnumerical operators.\\nComparisons can be chained. For example,a < b == ctests whethera is less thanb and moreoverb equals\\nc.\\nComparisons may be combined using the Boolean operatorsand and or, and the outcome of a comparison\\n(or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated withnot. These have lower priorities than comparison\\noperators; between them, not has the highest priority andor the lowest, so thatA and not B or C is\\nequivalent to(A and (not B)) or C. As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition.\\nThe Boolean operatorsand and or are so-calledshort-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from\\nleft to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, ifA and C are true\\nbut B is false,A and B and C does not evaluate the expressionC. When used as a general value and not as\\na Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.\\nIt is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example,\\n>>> string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Trondheim', 'Hammer Dance'\\n>>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3\\n>>> non_null\\n'Trondheim'\\nNote that in Python, unlike C, assignment cannot occur inside expressions.

The comparison useslex-\\nicographical ordering: ﬁrst the ﬁrst two items are compared, and if they diﬀer this determines the outcome\\nof the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is\\nexhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical com-\\nparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered\\nequal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser)\\n40 Chapter 5. Data Structures\"),\n",

Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better oﬀ using a\\ntext editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that ﬁle as input instead. This is\\nknown as creating ascript. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several ﬁles for easier\\nmaintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without\\ncopying its deﬁnition into each program.\\nTo support this, Python has a way to put deﬁnitions in a ﬁle and use them in a script or in an interactive\\ninstance of the interpreter. Such a ﬁle is called amodule; deﬁnitions from a module can beimported into\\nother modules or into themain module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed\\nat the top level and in calculator mode).\\nA module is a ﬁle containing Python deﬁnitions and statements. The ﬁle name is the module name with\\nthe suﬃx.py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the\\nglobal variable__name__. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a ﬁle calledfibo.py in the\\ncurrent directory with the following contents:\\n# Fibonacci numbers module\\ndef fib(n): # write Fibonacci series up to n\\na, b = 0, 1\\nwhile a < n:\\nprint(a, end=' ')\\na, b = b, a+b\\nprint()\\ndef fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n\\nresult = []\\na, b = 0, 1\\nwhile a < n:\\nresult.append(a)\\na, b = b, a+b\\nreturn result\\nNow enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the following command:\\n>>> import fibo\\nThis does not enter the names of the functions deﬁned infibo directly in the current symbol table; it only\\nenters the module namefibo there. Using the module name you can access the functions:\\n>>> fibo.fib(1000)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987\\n>>> fibo.fib2(100)\\n(continues on next page)\\n43\"),\n",

These statements are intended\\nto initialize the module. They are executed only theﬁrst time the module name is encountered in an import\\nstatement.1 (They are also run if the ﬁle is executed as a script.)\\nEach module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions\\ndeﬁned in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without\\nworrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you\\nare doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions,\\nmodname.itemname.\\nModules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place allimport statements at the\\nbeginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing\\nmodule’s global symbol table.\\nThere is a variant of theimport statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing\\nmodule’s symbol table. For example:\\n>>> from fibo import fib, fib2\\n>>> fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\nThis does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local symbol table (so in\\nthe example,fibo is not deﬁned).\\nThere is even a variant to import all names that a module deﬁnes:\\n>>> from fibo import *\\n>>> fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\nThis imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_). In most cases Python programmers\\ndo not use this facility since it introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some\\nthings you have already deﬁned.\\nNote that in general the practice of importing* from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often\\ncauses poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.\\nIf the module name is followed byas, then the name followingas is bound directly to the imported module.\\n>>> import fibo as fib\\n>>> fib.fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n1 In fact function deﬁnitions are also ‘statements’ that are ‘executed’; the execution of a module-level function deﬁnition\\nenters the function name in the module’s global symbol table.\\n44 Chapter 6.

The directory containing the script being run\\nis placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in\\nthat directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error\\nunless the replacement is intended. See sectionStandard Modules for more information.\\n6.1.3 “Compiled” Python ﬁles\\nTo speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the__pycache__\\ndirectory under the namemodule.version.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the compiled ﬁle;\\nit generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of\\nspam.py would be cached as__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc. This naming convention allows compiled\\nmodules from diﬀerent releases and diﬀerent versions of Python to coexist.\\nPython checks the modiﬁcation date of the source against the compiled version to see if it’s out of date\\nand needs to be recompiled. This is a completely automatic process. Also, the compiled modules are\\nplatform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with diﬀerent architectures.\\nPython does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the\\nresult for the module that’s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if\\nthere is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must\\nbe in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.\\nSome tips for experts:\\n• You can use the-O or -OO switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module.\\nThe-Oswitch removes assert statements, the-OOswitch removes both assert statements and __doc__\\nstrings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if\\nyou know what you’re doing. “Optimized” modules have anopt- tag and are usually smaller. Future\\nreleases may change the eﬀects of optimization.\\n• A program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a.pyc ﬁle than when it is read from a.py ﬁle;\\nthe only thing that’s faster about.pyc ﬁles is the speed with which they are loaded.\\n• The modulecompileall can create .pyc ﬁles for all modules in a directory.\\n• There is more detail on this process, including a ﬂow chart of the decisions, inPEP 3147 .\\n6.2 Standard Modules\\nPython comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library\\nReference (“Library Reference” hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access\\nto operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for eﬃciency\\nor to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls. The set of such modules is a\\nconﬁguration option which also depends on the underlying platform. For example, thewinreg module is\\nonly provided on Windows systems. One particular module deserves some attention:sys, which is built\\ninto every Python interpreter.

Ideally, one would hope that this\\nsomehow goes out to the ﬁlesystem, ﬁnds which submodules are present in the package, and imports them\\nall. This could take a long time and importing sub-modules might have unwanted side-eﬀects that should\\nonly happen when the sub-module is explicitly imported.\\nThe only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit index of the package. Theimportstatement\\nuses the following convention: if a package’s__init__.py code deﬁnes a list named__all__, it is taken to\\nbe the list of module names that should be imported whenfrom package import *is encountered. It is up\\nto the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package\\nauthors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package. For\\nexample, the ﬁlesound/effects/__init__.py could contain the following code:\\n__all__ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\\nThis would mean thatfrom sound.effects import * would import the three named submodules of the\\nsound package.\\nIf __all__is not deﬁned, the statementfrom sound.effects import *does not import all submodules from\\nthe packagesound.effects into the current namespace; it only ensures that the packagesound.effects\\nhas been imported (possibly running any initialization code in__init__.py) and then imports whatever\\nnames are deﬁned in the package. This includes any names deﬁned (and submodules explicitly loaded) by\\n__init__.py. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previousimport\\nstatements. Consider this code:\\nimport sound.effects.echo\\nimport sound.effects.surround\\nfrom sound.effects import *\\nIn this example, theecho and surround modules are imported in the current namespace because they are\\ndeﬁned in thesound.effects package when thefrom...import statement is executed. (This also works\\nwhen __all__ is deﬁned.)\\nAlthough certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use\\nimport *, it is still considered bad practice in production code.\\nRemember, there is nothing wrong with usingfrom Package import specific_submodule! In fact, this is\\nthe recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from\\ndiﬀerent packages.\\n6.4.2 Intra-package References\\nWhen packages are structured into subpackages (as with thesound package in the example), you can use\\nabsolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings packages. For example, if the modulesound.filters.\\nvocoder needs to use theecho module in the sound.effects package, it can usefrom sound.effects\\nimport echo.\\nYou can also write relative imports, with thefrom module import name form of import statement. These\\nimports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import. From\\nthe surround module for example, you might use:\\n50 Chapter 6. Modules'),\n",

This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.\\n7.1 Fancier Output Formatting\\nSo far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the print() function.\\n(A third way is using thewrite() method of ﬁle objects; the standard output ﬁle can be referenced as\\nsys.stdout. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)\\nOften you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated\\nvalues. There are several ways to format output.\\n• To useformatted string literals, begin a string withf or F before the opening quotation mark or triple\\nquotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between{ and } characters that\\ncan refer to variables or literal values.\\n>>> year = 2016 ; event = 'Referendum'\\n>>> f'Results of the {year} {event}'\\n'Results of the 2016 Referendum'\\n• The str.format() method of strings requires more manual eﬀort. You’ll still use{ and } to mark\\nwhere a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need\\nto provide the information to be formatted.\\n>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654 ; no_votes = 43_132_495\\n>>> percentage = yes_votes/(yes_votes+no_votes)\\n>>> '{:-9} YES votes {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)\\n' 42572654 YES votes 49.67%'\\n• Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations\\nto create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations\\nfor padding strings to a given column width.\\nWhen you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes,\\nyou can convert any value to a string with therepr() or str() functions.\\nThe str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while\\nrepr()is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter(or will force aSyntaxError\\nif there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human con-\\nsumption, str() will return the same value asrepr(). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists\\nand dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct\\nrepresentations.\\nSome examples:\\n53\"),\n",

Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called\\ndeserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored\\nin a ﬁle or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.\\nNote: The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many\\nprogrammers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.\\nIf you have an objectx, you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code:\\n>>> import json\\n>>> json.dumps([1, \\'simple\\', \\'list\\'])\\n\\'[1, \"simple\", \"list\"]\\'\\nAnother variant of thedumps() function, calleddump(), simply serializes the object to atext ﬁle . So iff is\\na text ﬁle object opened for writing, we can do this:\\njson.dump(x, f)\\nTo decode the object again, iff is atext ﬁle object which has been opened for reading:\\nx = json.load(f)\\nThis simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances\\nin JSON requires a bit of extra eﬀort.

There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors:syntax errors and exceptions.\\n8.1 Syntax Errors\\nSyntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while\\nyou are still learning Python:\\n>>> while True print(\\'Hello world\\')\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nwhile True print(\\'Hello world\\')\\n^\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\nThe parser repeats the oﬀending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line\\nwhere the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the tokenpreceding the arrow:\\nin the example, the error is detected at the functionprint(), since a colon (\\':\\') is missing before it. File\\nname and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script.\\n8.2 Exceptions\\nEven if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made\\nto execute it. Errors detected during execution are calledexceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you\\nwill soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs,\\nhowever, and result in error messages as shown here:\\n>>> 10 * (1/0)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\\n>>> 4 + spam*3\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nNameError: name \\'spam\\' is not defined\\n>>> \\'2\\' + 2\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: Can\\'t convert \\'int\\' object to str implicitly\\n61'),\n",

Exceptions come in diﬀerent types, and the\\ntype is printed as part of the message: the types in the example areZeroDivisionError, NameError and\\nTypeError. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred.\\nThis is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-deﬁned exceptions (although it is a\\nuseful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identiﬁers (not reserved keywords).\\nThe rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.\\nThe preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception happened, in the form of\\na stack traceback. In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display\\nlines read from standard input.\\nbltin-exceptions lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.\\n8.3 Handling Exceptions\\nIt is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks\\nthe user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using\\nControl-C or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled\\nby raising theKeyboardInterrupt exception.\\n>>> while True:\\n... try:\\n... x = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\\n... break\\n... except ValueError:\\n... print(\"Oops! That was no valid number. Try again... \")\\n...\\nThe try statement works as follows.\\n• First, thetry clause (the statement(s) between thetry and except keywords) is executed.\\n• If no exception occurs, theexcept clause is skipped and execution of thetry statement is ﬁnished.\\n• If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its\\ntype matches the exception named after theexcept keyword, the except clause is executed, and then\\nexecution continues after thetry statement.\\n• If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on\\nto outertry statements; if no handler is found, it is anunhandled exception and execution stops with\\na message as shown above.\\nA try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for diﬀerent exceptions. At\\nmost one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding try\\nclause, not in other handlers of the sametry statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as\\na parenthesized tuple, for example:\\n... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):\\n... pass\\nA class in anexcept clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but\\nnot the other way around — an except clause listing a derived class is not compatible with a base class).\\nFor example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:\\nclass B(Exception):\\npass\\n(continues on next page)\\n62 Chapter 8.

For example:\\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\\ntry:\\nf = open(arg, \\'r\\')\\nexcept OSError:\\nprint(\\'cannot open\\', arg)\\nelse:\\nprint(arg, \\'has\\', len(f.readlines()), \\'lines\\')\\nf.close()\\nThe use of theelse clause is better than adding additional code to thetry clause because it avoids acciden-\\ntally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by thetry … except statement.\\nWhen an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exception’sargument. The\\npresence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.\\nThe except clause may specify a variable after the exception name.

Creating a new class creates a newtype\\nof object, allowing newinstances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached\\nto it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (deﬁned by its class) for modifying its\\nstate.\\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of\\nnew syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python\\nclasses provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism\\nallows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a\\nmethod can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and\\nkinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at\\nruntime, and can be modiﬁed further after creation.\\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) arepublic (except see below\\nPrivate V ariables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for\\nreferencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit ﬁrst\\nargument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves\\nare objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types\\ncan be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special\\nsyntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redeﬁned for class instances.\\n(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make occasional use of Smalltalk and\\nC++ terms. I would use Modula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python\\nthan C++, but I expect that few readers have heard of it.)\\n9.1 A Word About Names and Objects\\nObjects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This\\nis known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a ﬁrst glance at Python, and\\ncan be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing\\nhas a possibly surprising eﬀect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists,\\ndictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the beneﬁt of the program, since aliases behave\\nlike pointers in some respects.

Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python\\nprogrammer.\\nLet’s begin with some deﬁnitions.\\nA namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python\\ndictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change\\nin the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such asabs(),\\nand built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation.\\nIn a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about\\nnamespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in diﬀerent namespaces; for instance, two\\ndiﬀerent modules may both deﬁne a functionmaximize without confusion — users of the modules must\\npreﬁx it with the module name.\\nBy the way, I use the wordattribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expressionz.\\nreal, real is an attribute of the objectz. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute\\nreferences: in the expressionmodname.funcname, modname is a module object andfuncname is an attribute\\nof it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the\\nglobal names deﬁned in the module: they share the same namespace!1\\nAttributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module\\nattributes are writable: you can writemodname.the_answer = 42. Writable attributes may also be deleted\\nwith thedel statement. For example,del modname.the_answerwill remove the attributethe_answer from\\nthe object named bymodname.\\nNamespaces are created at diﬀerent moments and have diﬀerent lifetimes. The namespace containing the\\nbuilt-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace\\nfor a module is created when the module deﬁnition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until\\nthe interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read\\nfrom a script ﬁle or interactively, are considered part of a module called__main__, so they have their own\\nglobal namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is calledbuiltins.)\\nThe local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function\\nreturns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a\\nbetter way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local\\nnamespace.\\nAscope isatextualregionofaPythonprogramwhereanamespaceisdirectlyaccessible. “Directlyaccessible”\\nhere means that an unqualiﬁed reference to a name attempts to ﬁnd the name in the namespace.\\nAlthough scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there\\nare at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\\n• the innermost scope, which is searched ﬁrst, contains the local names\\n• the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope,\\ncontains non-local, but also non-global names\\n• the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\\n• the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\\nIf a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the\\nmodule’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, thenonlocal statement\\ncan be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable\\nwill simply create anew local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable\\nunchanged).\\n1 Except for one thing. Module objects have a secret read-only attribute called __dict__ which returns the dictionary used\\nto implement the module’s namespace; the name __dict__ is an attribute but not a global name. Obviously , using this violates\\nthe abstraction of namespace implementation, and should be restricted to things like post-mortem debuggers.\\n70 Chapter 9. Classes'),\n",

The function deﬁnitions inside a class\\nnormally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again,\\nthis is explained later.\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all\\nassignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function deﬁnitions bind the name\\nof the new function here.\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is left normally (via the end), aclass object is created. This is basically a wrapper\\naround the contents of the namespace created by the class deﬁnition; we’ll learn more about class objects\\nin the next section. The original local scope (the one in eﬀect just before the class deﬁnition was entered)\\nis reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class deﬁnition header\\n(ClassName in the example).\\n9.3.2 Class Objects\\nClass objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\\nAttribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python:obj.name. Valid\\nattribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So,\\nif the class deﬁnition looked like this:\\nclass MyClass:\\n\"\"\"A simple example class\"\"\"\\ni = 12345\\ndef f(self):\\nreturn \\'hello world\\'\\nthen MyClass.i and MyClass.f are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object,\\nrespectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value ofMyClass.i by assign-\\nment. __doc__ is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class:\"A simple example\\nclass\".\\n72 Chapter 9.

Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function\\nthat returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):\\nx = MyClass()\\ncreates a newinstance of the class and assigns this object to the local variablex.\\nThe instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create\\nobjects with instances customized to a speciﬁc initial state. Therefore a class may deﬁne a special method\\nnamed __init__(), like this:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.data = []\\nWhen a class deﬁnes an__init__() method, class instantiation automatically invokes__init__() for the\\nnewly-created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by:\\nx = MyClass()\\nOf course, the__init__() method may have arguments for greater ﬂexibility. In that case, arguments given\\nto the class instantiation operator are passed on to__init__(). For example,\\n>>> class Complex:\\n... def __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\\n... self.r = realpart\\n... self.i = imagpart\\n...\\n>>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\\n>>> x.r, x.i\\n(3.0, -4.5)\\n9.3.3 Instance Objects\\nNow what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute\\nreferences. There are two kinds of valid attribute names, data attributes and methods.\\ndata attributes correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data\\nattributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are ﬁrst assigned\\nto. For example, if x is the instance ofMyClass created above, the following piece of code will print the\\nvalue 16, without leaving a trace:\\nx.counter = 1\\nwhile x.counter < 10:\\nx.counter = x.counter * 2\\nprint(x.counter)\\ndel x.counter\\nThe other kind of instance attribute reference is amethod. A method is a function that “belongs to” an\\nobject. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods\\nas well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on. However, in\\nthe following discussion, we’ll use the term method exclusively to mean methods of class instance objects,\\nunless explicitly stated otherwise.)\\nValid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By deﬁnition, all attributes of a class that\\nare function objects deﬁne corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example,x.f is a valid method\\nreference, since MyClass.f is a function, butx.i is not, sinceMyClass.i is not. But x.f is not the same\\nthing asMyClass.f — it is amethod object, not a function object.\\n9.3. A First Look at Classes 73'),\n",

However, it is not necessary to call a\\nmethod right away:x.f is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:\\nxf = x.f\\nwhile True:\\nprint(xf())\\nwill continue to printhello world until the end of time.\\nWhat exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed thatx.f() was called without an\\nargument above, even though the function deﬁnition forf() speciﬁed an argument. What happened to the\\nargument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without\\nany — even if the argument isn’t actually used…\\nActually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is\\npassed as the ﬁrst argument of the function. In our example, the callx.f() is exactly equivalent toMyClass.\\nf(x). In general, calling a method with a list ofn arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding\\nfunction with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the ﬁrst\\nargument.\\nIf you still don’t understand how methods work, a look at the implementation can perhaps clarify matters.\\nWhen a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes\\na valid class attribute that is a function object, a method object is created by packing (pointers to) the\\ninstance object and the function object just found together in an abstract object: this is the method object.\\nWhen the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance\\nobject and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.\\n9.3.5 Class and Instance Variables\\nGenerally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for at-\\ntributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:\\nclass Dog:\\nkind = 'canine' # class variable shared by all instances\\ndef __init__(self, name):\\nself.name = name # instance variable unique to each instance\\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\\n>>> d.kind # shared by all dogs\\n'canine'\\n>>> e.kind # shared by all dogs\\n'canine'\\n>>> d.name # unique to d\\n'Fido'\\n>>> e.name # unique to e\\n'Buddy'\\n74 Chapter 9.

Possible conventions include capitalizing method names, preﬁxing data attribute names\\nwith a small unique string (perhaps just an underscore), or using verbs for methods and nouns for data\\nattributes.\\nData attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. In\\nother words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types. In fact, nothing in Python\\nmakes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention.

Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance\\nobject without aﬀecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conﬂicts are avoided — again, a naming\\nconvention can save a lot of headaches here.\\nThere is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I ﬁnd that\\nthis actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance\\nvariables when glancing through a method.\\nOften, the ﬁrst argument of a method is calledself. This is nothing more than a convention: the name\\nself has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention\\nyour code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that aclass browser\\nprogram might be written that relies upon such a convention.\\nAny function object that is a class attribute deﬁnes a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary\\nthat the function deﬁnition is textually enclosed in the class deﬁnition: assigning a function object to a local\\nvariable in the class is also ok. For example:\\n# Function defined outside the class\\ndef f1(self, x, y):\\nreturn min(x, x+y)\\nclass C:\\nf = f1\\ndef g(self):\\nreturn 'hello world'\\nh = g\\nNow f, g and h are all attributes of classC that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all\\nmethods of instances ofC — h being exactly equivalent tog. Note that this practice usually only serves to\\nconfuse the reader of a program.\\nMethods may call other methods by using method attributes of theself argument:\\nclass Bag:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.data = []\\ndef add(self, x):\\nself.data.append(x)\\ndef addtwice(self, x):\\nself.add(x)\\nself.add(x)\\nMethods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated\\nwith a method is the module containing its deﬁnition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one\\nrarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the\\nglobal scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods,\\nas well as functions and classes deﬁned in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself deﬁned in this\\nglobal scope, and in the next section we’ll ﬁnd some good reasons why a method would want to reference its\\nown class.\\nEach value is an object, and therefore has aclass (also called itstype).

The\\nsyntax for a derived class deﬁnition looks like this:\\nclass DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):\\n<statement-1>\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n<statement-N>\\nThe name BaseClassName must be deﬁned in a scope containing the derived class deﬁnition. In place of\\na base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the\\nbase class is deﬁned in another module:\\nclass DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):\\nExecution of a derived class deﬁnition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is\\nconstructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested\\nattribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied\\nrecursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.\\nThere’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes:DerivedClassName()creates a new instance of\\nthe class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending\\ndown the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.\\nDerived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when\\ncalling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method deﬁned in the\\nsame base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers:\\nall methods in Python are eﬀectivelyvirtual.)\\nAn overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base\\nclass method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call\\nBaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments). This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that\\nthis only works if the base class is accessible asBaseClassName in the global scope.)\\nPython has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\\n• Use isinstance() to check an instance’s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.\\n__class__ is int or some class derived fromint.\\n• Use issubclass() to check class inheritance:issubclass(bool, int)is True since bool is a subclass\\nof int. However,issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass ofint.\\n9.5.1 Multiple Inheritance\\nPython supports a form of multiple inheritance as well.

Thus, if an attribute is not found inDerivedClassName, it is searched for inBase1, then (recursively)\\nin the base classes ofBase1, and if it was not found there, it was searched for inBase2, and so on.\\nIn fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support\\ncooperative calls to super(). This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as\\ncall-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.\\nDynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond re-\\nlationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the\\nbottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from object, so any case of multiple inheritance\\nprovides more than one path to reachobject. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than\\nonce, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right order-\\ning speciﬁed in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class\\ncan be subclassed without aﬀecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties\\nmake it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.\\n9.6 Private Variables\\n“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python.\\nHowever, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name preﬁxed with an underscore\\n(e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data\\nmember). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\\nSince there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names\\ndeﬁned by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, calledname mangling.

The same restriction applies togetattr(), setattr() and delattr(),\\nas well as when referencing__dict__ directly.\\n9.7 Odds and Ends\\nSometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the Pascal “record” or C “struct”, bundling together a\\nfew named data items. An empty class deﬁnition will do nicely:\\nclass Employee:\\npass\\njohn = Employee() # Create an empty employee record\\n# Fill the fields of the record\\njohn.name = \\'John Doe\\'\\njohn.dept = \\'computer lab\\'\\njohn.salary = 1000\\nA piece of Python code that expects a particular abstract data type can often be passed a class that emulates\\nthe methods of that data type instead. For instance, if you have a function that formats some data from\\na ﬁle object, you can deﬁne a class with methodsread() and readline() that get the data from a string\\nbuﬀer instead, and pass it as an argument.\\nInstance method objects have attributes, too:m.__self__ is the instance object with the methodm(), and\\nm.__func__ is the function object corresponding to the method.\\n9.8 Iterators\\nBy now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be looped over using afor statement:\\nfor element in [1, 2, 3]:\\nprint(element)\\nfor element in (1, 2, 3):\\nprint(element)\\nfor key in {\\'one\\':1, \\'two\\':2}:\\nprint(key)\\nfor char in \"123\":\\nprint(char)\\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"):\\nprint(line, end=\\'\\')\\nThis style of access is clear, concise, and convenient. The use of iterators pervades and uniﬁes Python.\\nBehind the scenes, thefor statement callsiter() on the container object. The function returns an iterator\\nobject that deﬁnes the method__next__() which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When\\nthere are no more elements, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception which tells the for loop to\\nterminate. You can call the__next__() method using thenext() built-in function; this example shows how\\nit all works:\\n>>> s = \\'abc\\'\\n>>> it = iter(s)\\n>>> it\\n(continues on next page)\\n9.7.

What makes generators so compact is that the__iter__() and __next__() methods are\\ncreated automatically.\\nAnother key feature is that the local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls.\\nThis made the function easier to write and much more clear than an approach using instance variables like\\nself.index and self.data.\\nIn addition to automatic method creation and saving program state, when generators terminate, they au-\\ntomatically raise StopIteration. In combination, these features make it easy to create iterators with no\\nmore eﬀort than writing a regular function.\\n9.10 Generator Expressions\\nSome simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a syntax similar to list comprehensions\\nbut with parentheses instead of square brackets. These expressions are designed for situations where the gen-\\nerator is used right away by an enclosing function. Generator expressions are more compact but less versatile\\nthan full generator deﬁnitions and tend to be more memory friendly than equivalent list comprehensions.\\nExamples:\\n>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10)) # sum of squares\\n285\\n>>> xvec = [10, 20, 30]\\n>>> yvec = [7, 5, 3]\\n>>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec)) # dot product\\n260\\n>>> from math import pi, sin\\n>>> sine_table = {x: sin(x*pi/180) for x in range(0, 91)}\\n>>> unique_words = set(word for line in page for word in line.split())\\n>>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)\\n>>> data = 'golf'\\n>>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))\\n['f', 'l', 'o', 'g']\\n9.10.

Despite the modules names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.\\n• The email package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and otherRFC 2822-\\nbased message documents. Unlikesmtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the\\nemail package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including\\nattachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.\\n• The json package provides robust support for parsing this popular data interchange format. Thecsv\\nmodule supports direct reading and writing of ﬁles in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly sup-\\nported by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by thexml.etree.ElementTree,\\nxml.dom and xml.sax packages.

To that end, the threading module provides a number of synchronization primitives including\\nlocks, events, condition variables, and semaphores.\\nWhile those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems that are diﬃcult to reproduce.\\nSo, the preferred approach to task coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread\\nand then use thequeue module to feed that thread with requests from other threads. Applications using\\nQueue objects for inter-thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, and\\nmore reliable.\\n11.5 Logging\\nThe logging module oﬀers a full featured and ﬂexible logging system.

Other output options include routing messages through email, datagrams, sockets, or to an HTTP\\nServer. New ﬁlters can select diﬀerent routing based on message priority:DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and\\nCRITICAL.\\nTheloggingsystemcanbeconﬁgureddirectlyfromPythonorcanbeloadedfromausereditableconﬁguration\\nﬁle for customized logging without altering the application.\\n92 Chapter 11.

The memory is freed shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated.\\nThis approach works ﬁne for most applications but occasionally there is a need to track objects only as long\\nas they are being used by something else. Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes\\nthem permanent. The weakref module provides tools for tracking objects without creating a reference.\\nWhen the object is no longer needed, it is automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is\\ntriggered for weakref objects. Typical applications include caching objects that are expensive to create:\\n>>> import weakref, gc\\n>>> class A:\\n... def __init__(self, value):\\n... self.value = value\\n... def __repr__(self):\\n... return str(self.value)\\n...\\n>>> a = A(10) # create a reference\\n>>> d = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\'] = a # does not create a reference\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\'] # fetch the object if it is still alive\\n10\\n>>> del a # remove the one reference\\n>>> gc.collect() # run garbage collection right away\\n0\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\'] # entry was automatically removed\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nd[\\'primary\\'] # entry was automatically removed\\nFile \"C:/python37/lib/weakref.py\", line 46, in __getitem__\\no = self.data[key]()\\nKeyError: \\'primary\\'\\n11.7 Tools for Working with Lists\\nMany data structure needs can be met with the built-in list type. However, sometimes there is a need for\\nalternative implementations with diﬀerent performance trade-oﬀs.\\nThe arraymodule provides anarray()object that is like a list that stores only homogeneous data and stores\\nit more compactly. The following example shows an array of numbers stored as two byte unsigned binary\\nnumbers (typecode\"H\") rather than the usual 16 bytes per entry for regular lists of Python int objects:\\n>>> from array import array\\n>>> a = array(\\'H\\', [4000, 10, 700, 22222])\\n>>> sum(a)\\n26932\\n>>> a[1:3]\\narray(\\'H\\', [10, 700])\\nThe collections module provides adeque() object that is like a list with faster appends and pops from\\nthe left side but slower lookups in the middle. These objects are well suited for implementing queues and\\nbreadth ﬁrst tree searches:\\n11.6. Weak References 93'),\n",

The lowest valued entry\\nis always kept at position zero. This is useful for applications which repeatedly access the smallest element\\nbut do not want to run a full list sort:\\n>>> from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush\\n>>> data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]\\n>>> heapify(data) # rearrange the list into heap order\\n>>> heappush(data, -5) # add a new entry\\n>>> [heappop(data) for i in range(3)] # fetch the three smallest entries\\n[-5, 0, 1]\\n11.8 Decimal Floating Point Arithmetic\\nThe decimal module oﬀers a Decimal datatype for decimal ﬂoating point arithmetic. Compared to the\\nbuilt-in float implementation of binary ﬂoating point, the class is especially helpful for\\n• ﬁnancial applications and other uses which require exact decimal representation,\\n• control over precision,\\n• control over rounding to meet legal or regulatory requirements,\\n• tracking of signiﬁcant decimal places, or\\n• applications where the user expects the results to match calculations done by hand.\\nFor example, calculating a 5% tax on a 70 cent phone charge gives diﬀerent results in decimal ﬂoating point\\nand binary ﬂoating point. The diﬀerence becomes signiﬁcant if the results are rounded to the nearest cent:\\n>>> from decimal import *\\n>>> round(Decimal(\\'0.70\\') * Decimal(\\'1.05\\'), 2)\\nDecimal(\\'0.74\\')\\n>>> round(.70 * 1.05, 2)\\n0.73\\n94 Chapter 11.

For example,\\nthe decimal fraction\\n0.125\\nhas value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the binary fraction\\n0.001\\nhas value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real diﬀerence being that the\\nﬁrst is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.\\nUnfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is\\nthat, in general, the decimal ﬂoating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary ﬂoating-\\npoint numbers actually stored in the machine.\\nThe problem is easier to understand at ﬁrst in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate\\nthat as a base 10 fraction:\\n0.3\\nor, better,\\n0.33\\nor, better,\\n0.333\\nand so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3,\\nbut will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.\\nIn the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be\\nrepresented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the inﬁnitely repeating fraction\\n0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...\\nStop at any ﬁnite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most machines today, ﬂoats are\\napproximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the ﬁrst 53 bits starting with the most\\nsigniﬁcant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is\\n3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55 which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.\\nMany users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python only prints\\na decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine. On\\nmost machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it\\nwould have to display\\n105'),\n",

The problem with “0.1” is explained in\\nprecise detail below, in the “Representation Error” section.

The\\nerrors in Python ﬂoat operations are inherited from the ﬂoating-point hardware, and on most machines are\\non the order of no more than 1 part in 2**53 per operation. That’s more than adequate for most tasks, but\\nyou do need to keep in mind that it’s not decimal arithmetic and that every ﬂoat operation can suﬀer a new\\nrounding error.\\nWhile pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of ﬂoating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you\\nexpect in the end if you simply round the display of your ﬁnal results to the number of decimal digits you\\nexpect. str() usually suﬃces, and for ﬁner control see thestr.format() method’s format speciﬁers in\\nformatstrings.\\nFor use cases which require exact decimal representation, try using thedecimal module which implements\\ndecimal arithmetic suitable for accounting applications and high-precision applications.\\nAnother form of exact arithmetic is supported by thefractions module which implements arithmetic based\\non rational numbers (so the numbers like 1/3 can be represented exactly).\\nIf you are a heavy user of ﬂoating point operations you should take a look at the Numerical Python package\\nand many other packages for mathematical and statistical operations supplied by the SciPy project. See\\n<https://scipy.org>.\\nPython provides tools that may help on those rare occasions when you reallydo want to know the exact\\nvalue of a ﬂoat. Thefloat.as_integer_ratio() method expresses the value of a ﬂoat as a fraction:\\n>>> x = 3.14159\\n>>> x.as_integer_ratio()\\n(3537115888337719, 1125899906842624)\\nSince the ratio is exact, it can be used to losslessly recreate the original value:\\n>>> x == 3537115888337719 / 1125899906842624\\nTrue\\nThe float.hex() method expresses a ﬂoat in hexadecimal (base 16), again giving the exact value stored by\\nyour computer:\\n>>> x.hex()\\n'0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1'\\nThis precise hexadecimal representation can be used to reconstruct the ﬂoat value exactly:\\n>>> x == float.fromhex('0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1')\\nTrue\\nSince the representation is exact, it is useful for reliably porting values across diﬀerent versions of Python\\n(platform independence) and exchanging data with other languages that support the same format (such as\\nJava and C99).\\nAnother helpful tool is themath.fsum() function which helps mitigate loss-of-precision during summation.\\nIt tracks “lost digits” as values are added onto a running total. That can make a diﬀerence in overall accuracy\\nso that the errors do not accumulate to the point where they aﬀect the ﬁnal total:\\n>>> sum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0\\nFalse\\n>>> math.fsum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0\\nTrue\\n107\"),\n",

Rewriting\\n1 / 10 ~= J / (2**N)\\nas\\nJ ~= 2**N / 10\\nand recalling thatJ has exactly 53 bits (is>= 2**52 but < 2**53), the best value forN is 56:\\n>>> 2**52 <= 2**56 // 10 < 2**53\\nTrue\\nThat is, 56 is the only value forN that leavesJ with exactly 53 bits. The best possible value forJ is then\\nthat quotient rounded:\\n>>> q, r = divmod(2**56, 10)\\n>>> r\\n6\\nSince the remainder is more than half of 10, the best approximation is obtained by rounding up:\\n>>> q+1\\n7205759403792794\\nTherefore the best possible approximation to 1/10 in 754 double precision is:\\n7205759403792794 / 2 ** 56\\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by two reduces the fraction to:\\n3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55\\nNote that since we rounded up, this is actually a little bit larger than 1/10; if we had not rounded up, the\\nquotient would have been a little bit smaller than 1/10.

In interactive mode, it\\nthen returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a ﬁle, it exits with a nonzero exit status after\\nprinting the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by anexcept clause in atry statement are not errors in this\\ncontext.) Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit; this applies to internal\\ninconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard\\nerror stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.\\nTyping the interrupt character (usuallyControl-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels\\nthe input and returns to the primary prompt.1 Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises\\nthe KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by atry statement.\\n16.1.2 Executable Python Scripts\\nOn BSD’ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the\\nline\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3.5\\n(assuming that the interpreter is on the user’sPATH) at the beginning of the script and giving the ﬁle an\\nexecutable mode. The #! must be the ﬁrst two characters of the ﬁle. On some platforms, this ﬁrst line\\nmust end with a Unix-style line ending ('\\\\n'), not a Windows ('\\\\r\\\\n') line ending. Note that the hash, or\\npound, character,'#', is used to start a comment in Python.\\nThe script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using thechmod command.\\n$ chmod +x myscript.py\\nOn Windows systems, there is no notion of an “executable mode”. The Python installer automatically\\nassociates .py ﬁles with python.exe so that a double-click on a Python ﬁle will run it as a script. The\\nextension can also be.pyw, in that case, the console window that normally appears is suppressed.\\n16.1.3 The Interactive Startup File\\nWhen you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some standard commands executed every\\ntime the interpreter is started.

Imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary\\nunit (the square root of-1), often writteni in mathematics orj in engineering. Python has built-in\\nsupport for complex numbers, which are written with this latter notation; the imaginary part is written\\nwith aj suﬃx, e.g.,3+1j.

When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in functioniter(), it returns an\\niterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables,\\nit is usually not necessary to calliter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. Thefor statement\\ndoes that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the\\nduration of the loop. See alsoiterator, sequence, andgenerator.\\niterator An object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the iterator’s__next__() method\\n(or passing it to the built-in functionnext()) return successive items in the stream. When no more\\ndata are available aStopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point, the iterator object is\\nexhausted and any further calls to its__next__() method just raiseStopIteration again. Iterators\\nare required to have an__iter__() method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is\\nalso iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One notable exception\\nis code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as alist) produces a fresh\\nnew iterator each time you pass it to theiter() function or use it in afor loop. Attempting this\\nwith an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass,\\nmaking it appear like an empty container.\\nMore information can be found in typeiter.\\nkey function A key function or collation function is a callable that returns a value used for sorting or\\nordering.

Guido remains Python’s\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI,\\nsee https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen\\nPythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now\\nZope Corporation; seehttp://www.zope.com/). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, seehttps:\\n//www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-proﬁt organization created speciﬁcally to own Python-related\\nIntellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (seehttps://opensource.org/ for the Open Source Deﬁnition). Histor-\\nically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the\\nvarious releases.\\nRelease Derived from Y ear Owner GPL compatible?\\n0.9.0 thru 1.2 n/a 1991-1995 CWI yes\\n1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes\\n1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no\\n2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no\\n1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI no\\n2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no\\n2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes\\n2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes\\n2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes\\n2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes\\n2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes\\nNote: GPL-compatible doesn’t mean that we’re distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses,\\nunlike the GPL, let you distribute a modiﬁed version without making your changes open source.
