Recent efforts have been devoted to modeling\\ncomplex stock correlations toward joint stock price forecast-\\ning. Existing works share a common neural architecture that\\nlearns temporal patterns from individual stock series and then\\nmixes up temporal representations to establish stock correla-\\ntions. However, they only consider time-aligned stock cor-\\nrelations stemming from all the input stock features, which\\nsuffer from two limitations. First, stock correlations often oc-\\ncur momentarily and in a cross-time manner. Second, the fea-\\nture effectiveness is dynamic with market variation, which af-\\nfects both the stock sequential patterns and their correlations.\\nTo address the limitations, this paper introduces MASTER, a\\nMArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the mo-\\nmentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages mar-\\nket information for automatic feature selection. MASTER el-\\negantly tackles the complex stock correlation by alternatively\\nengaging in intra-stock and inter-stock information aggrega-\\ntion. Experiments show the superiority of MASTER com-\\npared with previous works and visualize the captured realistic\\nstock correlation to provide valuable insights.\\nIntroduction\\nStock price forecasting, which utilizes historical data col-\\nlected from the stock market to predict future trends, is a\\nvital technique for profitable stock investment. Unlike sta-\\ntionary time series that often exhibit regular patterns such\\nas periodicity and steady trends, the dynamics in the stock\\nprice series are intricate because stock prices fluctuate sub-\\nject to multiple factors, including macroeconomic factors,\\ncapital flows, investor sentiments, and events. The mixing\\nof factors interweaves the stock market as a correlated net-\\nwork, making it difficult to precisely predict the individual\\nbehavior of stocks without taking other stocks into account.\\nMost previous works (Feng et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2021;\\nWang et al. 2021, 2022; Wang, Qu, and Chen 2022) in the\\nfield of stock correlation have relied on predefined concepts,\\nrelationships, or rules and established astatic correlation\\ngraph, e.g., stocks in the same industry are connected to each\\n*This work was done during her internship at Alibaba Group.\\n†Corresponding author.\\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

The dashed lines\\nrepresent the underlying momentary and cross-time stock\\ncorrelations, which reside between some(stock1, time1),\\n(stock2, time2) pairs.\\nother. While these methods provide insights into the rela-\\ntions between stocks, they do not account for real-time stock\\ncorrelations. For example, different stocks within the same\\nindustry can experience opposite price movements on a par-\\nticular day. Additionally, the pre-defined relationships may\\nnot be generalizable to new stocks in an evolving market\\nwhere events such as company listing, delisting, or changes\\nin the main business happen normally. Another line of re-\\nsearch (Yoo et al. 2021) follows the Transformer architec-\\nture (Vaswani et al. 2017) and uses the self-attention mech-\\nanism to compute dynamic stock correlations. This data-\\ndriven manner is more flexible and applicable to the time-\\nvarying stock sets in the market. Despite different schemes\\nfor establishing stock correlations, the existing methods gen-\\nerally follow a common two-step computation flow. As de-\\npicted in Figure 1, the first step is using a sequential encoder\\nto summarize the historical sequence of stock features and\\nobtain stock representation, and the second step is to refine\\neach stock representation by aggregating information from\\ncorrelated stocks using graph encoders or attention mecha-\\nnism. However, such a flow suffers from two limitations.\\nFirst, existing works distill an overall stock representa-\\ntion and blur the time-specific details of stock sequence,\\nleading to weakness in modeling the de-facto stock corre-\\nlations, which often occursmomentarily and in a cross-time\\nmanner (Bennett, Cucuringu, and Reinert 2022). To be spe-\\ncific, the stock correlation is highly dynamic and may re-\\nside in misaligned time steps rather than holding through the\\nwhole lookback period. This is because the dominating fac-\\ntors of stock prices constantly change, and different stocks\\nmay react to the same factors with different delays.

However, in addition to the increased computa-\\ntional complexity, this approach faces practical difficulties\\nbecause the stock forecasting task is in intense data hunger.\\nIntuitively, there are only around 250 trading days per year,\\nproducing limited observations on stocks. When the model\\nadopts such a large attention field with insufficient training\\nsamples, it often struggles to optimize and may even fall\\ninto suboptimal solutions. Although clustering approaches\\nlike local sensitive hashing (Kitaev, Kaiser, and Levskaya\\n2020) have been proposed to reduce the size of the attention\\nfield, they are sensitive to initialization, which is a fatal issue\\nin a data-hungry domain like stock forecasting. To address\\nthese challenges, we propose a novel stock transformer ar-\\nchitecture specifically designed for stock price forecasting.\\nRather than directly modeling theτ × |S|attention field or\\nusing clustering-based approximation methods, our model\\naggregates information from different time steps and differ-\\nent stocks alternately to model the realistic stock correlation\\nand facilitate model learning.\\nAnother limitation of existing works is that they ignore\\nthe impact of varying market status. In long-term practice\\nwith the market variation, one essential observation by in-\\nvestors is that the features come into effect and expire dy-\\nnamically. The effectiveness of features influences both the\\nintra-stock sequential pattern and the stock correlation. For\\ninstance, in a bull market, the correlations among stocks are\\nmore significant due to the investors’ optimism. Traditional\\ninvestors repeatedly conduct statistical examinations to se-\\nlect effective features, which are exhaustive and face a gap\\nwhen integrated with learning-based methods. To save hu-\\nman efforts, we are motivated to equip our stock transformer\\nwith a novel gating mechanism, which incorporates the mar-\\nket information to perform automatic feature selection. We\\nname the proposed method MASTER, standing forMArket-\\nGuided Stock TransformER. To summarize, our main con-\\ntributions are as follows.\\n• We propose a novel stock transformer for stock price\\nforecasting to effectively capture the stock correlation. To\\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to mine the\\nmomentary and cross-time stock correlation with learning-\\nbased methods.\\n• We introduce a novel gating mechanism that integrates\\nmarket information to automatically select relevant features\\nand adapt to varying market scenarios.\\n• We conducted experiments to validate the designs of our\\nproposed method and demonstrated its superiority compared\\nto baselines. The visualization results provided valuable in-\\nsights into the real-time dynamics of stock correlations.\\nMethodology\\nProblem Formulation\\nThe indicators of each stock u ∈ Sare collected at every\\ntime step t ∈ [1, τ] to form the feature vector xu,t ∈ RF .\\nFollowing existing works on stock market analysis (Feng\\net al. 2018; Sawhney et al. 2020; Huynh et al. 2023), we\\nfocus on the prediction of the change in stock price rather\\nthan the absolute value. The return ratio,˜ru = (cu,τ+d −\\ncu,τ+1)/cu,τ+1, is the relative close price change in d days,\\nwhere cu,t denotes the close price of stock u at time step\\nt, and d represents the predetermined prediction interval.\\nThe return ratio normalizes the market price variety be-\\ntween different stocks in comparison to the absolute price\\nchange. Since stock investment is to rank and select the\\nmost profitable stocks, we perform daily Z-score normaliza-\\ntion of return ratio to encode the label with the rankings,\\nru = NormS(˜ru), as in previous work (Yang et al. 2020).\\nDefinition 1 (Stock Price Forecasting) Given stock fea-\\ntures {xu,t}u∈S,t∈[1,τ], the stock price forecasting is to\\njointly predict the future normalized return ratio{ru}u∈S.\\nOverview\\nFigure 2 depicts the architecture of our proposed method\\nMASTER, which consists of five steps. (1)Market-Guided\\nGating. We construct a vector representing the current mar-\\nket status mτ and leverage it to rescale feature vectors by\\na gating mechanism, achieving market-guided feature selec-\\ntion. (2)Intra-Stock Aggregation. Within the sequence of\\neach stock, at each time step, we aggregate information from\\nother time steps to generate a local embedding that preserves\\nthe temporal local details of the stock while collecting all\\nimportant signals along the time axis. The local embedding\\nhu,t will serve as relays and transport the collected signals to\\nother stocks in subsequent modules. (3)Inter-Stock Aggre-\\ngation. At each time step, we compute stock correlation with\\nthe attention mechanism, and each stock further aggregates\\nthe local embeddings of other stocks. The aggregated infor-\\nmation zu,t, which we refer to as temporal embedding, con-\\ntains not only the information of the momentarily correlated\\nstocks at t but also preserves the personal information of u.\\n(4) Temporal Aggregation.

S′ and d′ are identical to the aforementioned defi-\\nnitions. Now we present the market-guided stock price fore-\\ncasting task.\\nDefinition 2 (Market-Guided Stock Price Forecasting)\\nGiven {xu,t}u∈S,t∈[1,τ] and the constructed market status\\nvector mτ , market-guided stock price forecasting is to\\njointly predict the future normalized return ratio{ru}u∈S.\\nGating Mechanism The gating mechanism generates one\\nscaling coefficient for each feature dimension to enlarge or\\nshrink the magnitude of the feature, thereby emphasizing\\nor diminishing the amount of information from the feature\\nflowing to the subsequent modules. The gating mechanism\\nis learned by the model training, and the coefficient is op-\\ntimized by how much the feature contributes to improve\\nforecasting performance, thus reflecting the feature effec-\\ntiveness.\\nGiven the market status representation mτ , |mτ | = F′,\\nwe first use a single linear layer to transform mτ into the\\nfeature dimension F = |xu,t|. Then, we perform Softmax\\nalong the feature dimension to obtain a distribution.\\nα(mτ ) =F · softmaxβ(Wαmτ + bα),\\nwhere Wα, bα are learnable matrix and bias,β is the temper-\\nature hyperparameter controlling the sharpness of the output\\ndistribution. Softmax compels competition among features\\nto distinguish the effective ones and ineffective ones. Here,\\na smaller temperatureβ encourages the distribution to fo-\\ncus on certain dimensions and the gating effect is stronger\\nwhile a largerβ makes the distribution inclined to even and\\nthe gating effect is weaker. Note that we enlarge the value at\\neach dimension byF times as the scaling coefficient. This\\noperation compares the generated distribution with a uni-\\nform distribution where each dimension is1/F, to deter-\\nmine whether to enlarge or shrink the value. The intuition\\nto generate coefficients frommτ is that the effectiveness of\\nfeatures are influenced by market status. For example, if the\\nmodel learns moving average (MA) factor is useful during\\nvolatile market periods, it will emphasize MA when the mar-\\nket becomes volatile again. Under the samemτ , α are shared\\nfor {xu,t}, u ∈ S, t ∈ [1, τ], in that we incorporate the most\\nrecent market status to perform unified feature selection. The\\nrescaled feature vectors are˜xu,t = α(mτ ) ◦ xu,t, where ◦ is\\nthe Hadamard product.\\nIntra-Stock Aggregation\\nIn MASTER, we use intra-stock aggregation followed by\\ninter-stock aggregation to break down the large and complex\\nattention field. Although the entire market is complicated\\nwith diverse behaviors of individual stocks, the patterns of\\na specific stock tend to be relatively continuous. Therefore,\\nwe perform intra-stock aggregation first due to its smaller at-\\ntention field and simpler distribution. In our proposed intra-\\nstock aggregation, the feature at each time step aggregates\\ninformation from other time steps and forms a local embed-\\nding. Compared with existing works which initially mix the\\nfeature sequence into one representation (Yoo et al. 2021),\\nwe maintain a sequence of local embeddings which are ad-\\nvised with the important signals in sequence through intra-\\nstock aggregation while reserving the local details.\\nWe first send the rescaled feature vectors to a feature en-\\ncoder and transform them into the embedding space, yu,t =\\nf(˜xu,t), |yu,t| = D. We simply use a single linear layer as\\nf(·). Then, we apply a bi-directional sequential encoder to\\nobtain the local output at each time step t. Inspired by the\\nsuccess of transformer-based models in modeling sequential\\npatterns, we instantiate the sequential encoder with a single-\\nlayer transformer encoder (Vaswani et al. 2017). Each fea-\\nture vector at a particular time step is treated as a token, and\\nwe add a fixedD-dimensional sinusoidal positional encod-\\ning pt to mark the chronic order in the lookback window.\\nYu = ||t∈[1,τ]LN(f(˜xu,t) +pt),\\nwhere || denotes the concatenation of vectors and LN the\\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\\n164'),\n",

Then, the feature embedding at each\\ntime step queries from all time steps in the stock sequence.\\nWe introduce multi-head attention mechanisms, denoted as\\nMHA(·), with N1 heads to perform different aggregations in\\nparallel.

As a result, the local embedding hu,t\\nboth reserves the local details and encodes indicative signals\\nfrom other time steps.\\nInter-Stock Aggregation\\nThen, we consider aggregating information from correlated\\nstocks. Compared with existing works that distill an over-\\nall stock correlation, we establish a series of momentary\\nstock correlations corresponding to every time step. Instead\\nof using pre-defined relationships that face a mismatch with\\nthe proximity of real-time stock movements, we propose to\\nmine the asymmetric and dynamic inter-stock correlation\\nvia attention mechanism. The quality of the correlation will\\nbe measured by its contribution to improving the forecast-\\ning performance, and automatically optimized by the model\\ntraining process.\\nSpecifically, at each time step, we gather the local embed-\\ndings of all stocks H2\\nt = ||u∈Shu,t and perform multi-head\\nattention mechanism with N2 heads.\\nQ2\\nt = W2\\nQH2\\nt , K 2\\nt = W2\\nKH2\\nt , V 2\\nt = W2\\nV H2\\nt ,\\nZt = ||u∈Szu,t = FFN2(MHA2(Q2\\nt, K2\\nt , V2\\nt ) +H2\\nt ).\\nWith the residual connection of FFN, the temporal embed-\\nding zu,t is encoded with both the information from momen-\\ntarily correlated stocks and the personal information of stock\\nu itself. Our stock transformer is able to model the cross-\\ntime correlation of stocks, as shown in Figure 2 (Right). The\\nlocal details ofyv,j can first be conveyed tohv,i by the intra-\\nstock aggregation of stock v, and then transmitted to zu,i\\nby inter-stock aggregation at time step i, hence modeling\\nthe correlation from any (v, j) to (u, i). We further visualize\\nand explain the captured cross-time correlation in the exper-\\niments section.\\nTemporal Aggregation\\nIn contrast with existing works which obtain one embedding\\nfor each stock after modeling stock correlation (Feng et al.\\n2019), our approach produces a series of temporal embed-\\ndingszu,t, t∈ [1, τ]. Each zu,t is encoded with information\\nfrom stocks that are momentarily correlated with (u, t). To\\nsummarize the obtained temporal embeddings, we employ a\\ntemporal attention layer along the time axis.\\nλu,t = exp(zT\\nu,tWλzu,τ )\\nP\\ni∈[1,τ] exp(zT\\nu,iWλzu,τ ), e u =\\nX\\nt∈[1,τ]\\nλu,tzu,t,\\nwhere we use the latest temporal embedding zu,τ as the\\nquery vector, and compute the attention score λu,t in a hid-\\nden space with transformation matrix Wλ.\\nPrediction and Training\\nFinally, the comprehensive stock embedding eu is fed into\\na predictor g(·) for label regression. We use a single linear\\nlayer as the predictor, and the forecasting quality is mea-\\nsured by the MSE loss. In each batch, MASTER is jointly\\noptimized for all u ∈ Son a particular prediction date. A\\ntraining epoch is composed of multiple batches correspond-\\ning to different prediction dates in the training set.\\nˆru = g(eu), L =\\nX\\nu∈S\\nMSE(ru, ˆru).\\nDiscussions\\nRelationships with Existing Works Modeling stock cor-\\nrelations has long been an indispensable research direc-\\ntion for stock price prediction. Today, many researchers\\nand quantitative analysts, still opt for linear models, sup-\\nport vector machines, and tree-based methods for stock price\\nforecasting (Nugroho, Adji, and Fauziati 2014; Chen and\\nGuestrin 2016; Kamble 2017; Xie et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015;\\nPiccolo 1990). The aggregation of correlation information\\nwithin and between stocks is often achieved through fea-\\nture engineering, which relies heavily on manual expertise\\nand constantly faces the risk of factor decay. Inspired by\\nthe success of neural sequential data analysis, researchers\\nare driven to take into account the stock feature sequences\\nand learn the temporal correlation automatically. They de-\\nsign various sequential models, such as RNN-based (Feng\\net al. 2019; Sawhney et al. 2021; Yoo et al. 2021; Huynh\\net al. 2023), CNN-based (Wang et al. 2021), and attention-\\nbased models(Liu et al. 2019; Ding et al. 2020), to mine the\\ninternal temporal dynamics of a stock. Recent researches\\nfocus on the modeling of stock correlation, which adds\\na correlation module posterior to the sequential model as\\nillustrated in Figure 1. They propose to use graph-based\\n(Feng et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021, 2022),\\nhypergraph-based (Sawhney et al. 2021; Huynh et al. 2023)\\nand attention-based (Yoo et al. 2021; Xiang et al. 2022)\\nmodules to build the overall stock correlation and perform\\njoint prediction. Our MASTER is dedicated to momentary\\nand cross-time stock correlation mining. To do so, we de-\\nvelop a novel model architecture as in Figure 2 that is\\ngenuinely different from all existing methods. Furthermore,\\nMASTER is specialized for stock price forecasting, which\\nis distinct in data form and task properties from existing\\ntransformer-based models in spatial-temporal data (Bulat\\net al. 2021; Cong et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2023)\\nor multivariate time series domains (Zhang and Yan 2022;\\nNie et al. 2022).\\nComplexity Analysis We now analyze the computation\\ncomplexity of our proposed method.

According to the leaderboard of Qlib\\nplatform (Yang et al. 2020), it is one of the strongest base-\\nlines. • LSTM (Graves and Graves 2012), GRU (Cho et al.\\n2014), TCN (Bai, Kolter, and Koltun 2018), and Trans-\\nformer (Vaswani et al. 2017): Sequential baselines that lever-\\nage vanilla LSTM/GRU/temporal convolutional network/-\\nTransformer along the time axis for stock price forecasting.\\n•GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al. 2017): A graph-based baseline,\\nwhich first uses sequential encoder to gain stock presenta-\\ntion and then aggregates information by graph attention net-\\nworks1. • DTML (Yoo et al. 2021): A state-of-the-art stock\\ncorrelation mining method, which follows the framework in\\nFigure 1. DTML adopts the attention mechanism to mine the\\n1More discussion is provided in the supplementary materials.\\ndynamic correlation among stocks and also incorporates the\\nmarket information into the modeling.\\nEvaluation We adopt both ranking metrics and portfolio-\\nbased metrics to give a thorough evaluation of the model\\nperformance. Four ranking metrics, Information Coefficient\\n(IC), Rank Information Coefficient (RankIC), Information\\nRatio-based IC (ICIR) and Information Ratio-based RankIC\\n(RankICIR) are considered. IC and RankIC are the Pearson\\ncoefficient and Spearman coefficient averaged at a daily fre-\\nquency. ICIR and RankICIR are normalized metrics of IC\\nand RankIC by dividing the standard deviation. Those met-\\nrics are commonly used in literature (e.g., Xu et al. 2021 and\\nYang et al. 2020) to describe the performance of the forecast-\\ning results from the value and rank perspectives. Further-\\nmore, we employ two portfolio-based metrics to compare\\nthe investment profit and risk of each method. We simulate\\ndaily trading using a simple strategy that selects the top 30\\nstocks with the highest return ratio and reports the Excess\\nAnnualized Return (AR) and Information Ratio (IR) met-\\nrics. AR measures the annual expected excess return gener-\\nated by the investment, while IR measures the risk-adjusted\\nperformance of an investment.\\nImplementation We implemented MASTER 2 with Py-\\nTorch and build our methods based on the open-source quan-\\ntitative investment platform Qlib (Yang et al. 2020). For\\nDTML, we implement it based on the original paper since\\nthere is no official implementation publicly. For other base-\\nlines, we use their Qlib implementations. For hyperparame-\\nters of each baseline method, the layer number and model\\nsize are tuned from {1, 2, 3} and {128, 256, 512} respec-\\ntively. The learning ratelr is tuned among{10−i}i∈{3,4,5,6},\\nand we selected the best hyperparameters based on the IC\\nperformance in the validation stage. For hyperparameters of\\nMASTER, we tune the model sizeD and learning rate lr\\namong the same range as the baselines, and the final selec-\\ntion isD=256, lr=10−5 for all datasets; we set N1=4, N2=2\\nfor all datasets and β=5 and β=2 for CSI300 and CSI800\\nrespectively. More implementation details of baseline meth-\\nods are summarized in the supplementary materials. Each\\nmodel is trained for at most 40 epochs with early stopping.\\nAll the experiments are conducted on a server equipped with\\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8163 CPU, 128GB Memory, and\\na Tesla V100-SXM2 GPU (16GB Memory). Each experi-\\nment was repeated 5 times with random initialization and\\nthe average performance was reported.\\nOverall Performance (RQ1)\\nThe overall performance is reported in Table 1 MAS-\\nTER achieves the best results on 6/8 of the ranking met-\\nrics, and consistently outperforms all benchmarks in the\\nportfolio-based metrics. In particular, MASTER achieve\\n13%improvements in ranking metrics and 47% improve-\\nments in portfolio-based metrics compared to the second-\\nbest results in the average sense.

The achieve-\\nments in both types of metrics imply that MASTER is of\\ngood predicting ability on the whole stock set without sacri-\\nficing the accuracy of the important stocks. The significant\\nimprovements cast light on the importance of stock corre-\\nlation modeling, so that each stock can also benefit from\\nthe historical signals of other momentarily correlated stocks.\\nWe also observed all methods gain better performance on\\nCSI300 over CSI800. We believe it is because CSI300 con-\\nsists of companies with larger capitalization whose stock\\nprices are more predictable. When compared to the exist-\\ning stock correlation method (i.e., DTML), MASTER out-\\nperforms in all 6 metrics, which tells the proposed Market-\\nGuided Gating and aggregation techniques are more effi-\\ncient in mining cross-stock information than existing liter-\\nature.\\nStock Transformer Architecture (RQ2)\\nWe validate the effectiveness of our specialized stock trans-\\nformer architecture by experiments on four settings. (1)\\n(MA)STER, which is our stock transformer without the gat-\\ning. (2) (MA)STER-Bi, in which we substitute the single-\\nlayer transformer encoder with a bi-directional LSTM to\\nevince that the effectiveness of our proposed architecture\\nis not coupled with strong sequential encoders. (3) Naive,\\nwhich directly performs information aggregation amongτ ×\\n|S| tokens. (4) Clustering, in which we adapt the Local Sen-\\nsitive Hashing (Kitaev, Kaiser, and Levskaya 2020) to allo-\\ncate all tokens into 10 buckets by similarity and perform ag-\\ngregation within each group, which is a classic task-agnostic\\ntechnique to reduce the scale of the attention field. For a fair\\ncomparison, in (3) and (4), we first use the same transformer\\nencoder to extract token embedding and then use the same\\nmulti-head attention mechanism as in our stock transformer,\\nso the only difference is the attention field. Due to resource\\nlimits, we only experiment on CSI300 dataset. The results\\nin Table ?? illustrate the efficacy of our tailored stock trans-\\nformer architecture, which performs intra-stock aggregation\\nand inter-stock aggregation alternatively.\\nAblation Study (RQ3)\\nFirst, we conduct ablation study on (N1, N2) combination.\\nThe results of CSI300 are shown in Figure 3 and the results\\non CSI800 are similar. The difference among head combina-\\ntions is not significant compared with the inherent variance\\nunder each setting. In the studied range, most settings con-\\nsistently performed better than the baselines.\\nSecond, we study the influence of temperature β in the\\ngating mechanism. As explained before, a smaller β forces\\na stronger feature selection while a largerβ turns off the gat-\\ning effect. Figure 4 shows the performance with varying β.\\nThe CSI300 is a relatively easier dataset where most fea-\\ntures are quite effective, so the temperature is expected to\\nbe larger to relax the feature selection, while more powerful\\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\\n167'),\n",

Recent efforts have been devoted to modeling\\ncomplex stock correlations toward joint stock price forecast-\\ning. Existing works share a common neural architecture that\\nlearns temporal patterns from individual stock series and then\\nmixes up temporal representations to establish stock correla-\\ntions. However, they only consider time-aligned stock cor-\\nrelations stemming from all the input stock features, which\\nsuffer from two limitations. First, stock correlations often oc-\\ncur momentarily and in a cross-time manner. Second, the fea-\\nture effectiveness is dynamic with market variation, which af-\\nfects both the stock sequential patterns and their correlations.\\nTo address the limitations, this paper introduces MASTER, a\\nMArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the mo-\\nmentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages mar-\\nket information for automatic feature selection. MASTER el-\\negantly tackles the complex stock correlation by alternatively\\nengaging in intra-stock and inter-stock information aggrega-'),\n",
