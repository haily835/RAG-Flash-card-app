The participants adapted \\neach typing method (Shift, LP, DT) in a practice session lasting \\napproximately 7 min. During the practice session, participants typed \\nthree sentences provided using each method and were instructed to step \\nback appropriately for typing. The participants performed the tasks in \\ntheir respective positions they had set. They typed text while equipping \\nthe HMD with the randomly presented methods. The participants were \\ninstructed to type 10 sentences as quickly and accurately as possible \\nusing each typing method. Thus, the 10 sentences were composed of a \\nmixture of English uppercase and lowercase letters. Thirty sentences \\nwere provided to the participants, all from the phase sets of ( MacKenzie \\nand Soukoreff, 2003 ) and Enron Mobile ( Vertanen and Kristensson, \\n2011 ). They comprised more than two uppercase letters and fewer than \\n43 letters. The sentences were 280 – 302 characters in length, including \\nspaces, and contained 29 – 30 capitalized letters across the ten sentences. \\nUnder the DT condition, six words such as \"see,\" \"will,\" and \"agree,\" \\nwhere the same lowercase letter appeared consecutively, were included \\nacross the ten presented sentences. After completing the test under each \\ncondition, the participants removed their HMD and filled in the ques -',\n",

The \\npost-hoc grouping exhibited that the Shift ( M = 5.553, SD = 1.12) and the \\nDT ( M = 5.273, SD = 1.52) were more useful than the LP ( M = 4.187, \\nSD = 1.73). Here, the DT ( M = 5.700, SD = 1.21) was the easiest to use, \\nand the Shift ( M = 6.711, SD = 0.49) was the easiest to learn. Further, the \\nShift ( M = 5.392, SD = 1.27) and the DT ( M = 5.417, SD = 1.54) satisfied \\nusers more than the LP ( M = 4.208, SD = 1.63).

The presence of uppercase letters affects the \\nmeanings of words and their readability. By typing uppercase letters on a QWERTY keyboard, the layers can be \\nswitched using a modifier key. Considering that VE controllers are typically used in a VE, this input method can \\nresult in user fatigue and errors. Thus, this study proposed new alternative interactions for the modifier key input \\nand compared their typing performance and user experience. In an experiment, 30 participants were instructed \\nto type 10 sentences using different typing interaction methods (shift, long press, and double-tap) on a virtual \\nkeyboard in a VE. The typing speed, error rate, and number of backspace inputs were measured to compare \\ntyping performance.

This result was consistent with prior studies showing that \\ninteraction experiences and familiarity moved to a new environment, \\nthereby lowering mental demands ( Jacob et al., 2007 ; NORMAN, 2011 ). \\nThis is also consistent with the results of a study wherein experiences \\nhelped users clearly understand functionalities, enabling them to \\nperceive purpose and usage without additional learning processes \\n( Hollinworth and Hwang, 2011 ).\\nHowever, this study focused on the determining the results of the DT \\nmethod that achieved the best evaluation in terms of ease of use, satis -\\nfaction, preference, perceived workload, and typing performance. This \\nresult implies that the advantages of the DT keyboard performance and \\nUX overcome the cost of teaching users new interactions ( Boletsis and \\nKongsvik, 2019 ; Wang et al., 2023b ). The DT method demonstrated the \\nlowest workload in terms of effort and overall NASA-TLX scores. As \\nstated in 3.5. Experimental procedure, there were cases that the same \\nlowercase letter appeared consecutively under the DT condition. This \\nmay lead to unintended inputs contrary to user intent. Despite this issue, \\nthe DT method demonstrated good performance. The DT method was \\nfaster (8.83 WPM) than the other methods, and its difference from the LP \\nmethod was statistically significant. The DT method exhibited the lowest \\nerror rate.
